# MOVIE DATABASE (PP3 by Christofer Asplund)

Movie database is a program written in Python, wich runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.
The program is connected to a Google Sheet API that stores all data.

The user can view a complete list or a top 10 list of the movies they have watched and rated. The user can also
add new movies to the list and delete movies from the list.

### Exit Program (5 + Enter)
  - This option will close the program.
  
  
## Future Features
 - Allow users to review movies


## Data Model
I used a Movie class as my model. The program uses one instance of the Movie class to hold a movie when adding
a movie to the program.

The Movie class stores the movie title, movie rating and movie id.


## Testing

I have manually tested this program by doing the following:
 - Given invalid inputs: strings, numbers and other keyboard characters(ex. *^/&%â‚¬) when the program is expecting the opposite input.
 - Hard testing my local terminal and Code Institute Heroku terminal.
 - Making sure that my IDE isn't giving any type errors that doesn't match with the PEP8 style.


## Bugs



### Solved Bugs

- Option 3 had an input error when entering a string into the rating input. I solved it by making sure the input only accepts a float number between 0.0 - 5.0. And adding a print statement saying "Invalid data: Rating must be a float between 0.0 - 5.0." if a string is entered.

### Unsolved Bugs
 
- No unsolved bugs remaining.


## Deployment

This project was deployed using Code Instute's mock terminal on Heroku.

- Step by step for deployment: 
  - Fork or clone this repository.
  - Create a new Heroku app.
  - Buildbacks should be set in this order Python and NodeJs.
  - The Heroku app should be linked to this repository
  - Then click deploy and wait while the app is being built, when complete click view.
